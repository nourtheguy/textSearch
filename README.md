The created react app is a simple app that functions as a text search tool, with some simple CSS.

- Use 'npm start' to run the app
- Make sure the app's directory is selected to run the app using 'npm start'
- Once run, the app shows a search field
- I have inlcluded some short "articles" for the sake of proving the concept.
- Some articles are about art, other articles are about React, among others.
- Try to search for keywords such as "reach" or "engine" or "art".
- The app should work as intended.

Thank you.
